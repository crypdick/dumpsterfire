"canon"	"that is the japanese name written in english, the english name is tuffle, also it is debatable unless an official souce says whether or not it is canon."

"canon"	"but saying it's not canon isn't a fact, that's why i put the statement about it being debatable in the article since it doesn't lean one way or the other."
"canon"	"it is a fact that it's non canon. the plot holes, lack of continuity, not being created by toriyama, and etc., all make it non-canon until toei or toriyama say otherwise."
"canon"	"no, it's fact, if it's based on facts. if the facts point to it being non-canon, then it's non-canon."
"canon"	"but it's not a fact that's it's non-canon, no official source has said it's non-canon."
"canon"	"ugh...tj.....the facts make it non-canon. you don't need an official source for it to be non-canon. do we need an official source to say goku's clothes are orange? no. it's the same concept."
"canon"	"that's different and you know it. wp is about verifiability and it cannot be verified that gt isn't canon."
"canon"	"yes it can. =.= the facts make it non canon. wp is about facts and sources. you need to have one or the other"
"canon"	"look up the definition of fact. you believing it's not canon does not make that fact. it's your opinion, i don't know how you can't understand that."
"canon"	"tj, i did look up fact, and gave you the definition. the facts point to it being non-canon, so logically, it is non-canon. you're the one pushing your personal opinion into the article."
"canon"	"i'm not pushing my opionion, if i was then i would have left my original edit in(saying that he was canon) rather than the current edt(that it's debatable). it's just speculation from both of us."
"canon"	"it being debatable is your opinion. it being non-canon is a fact, which was concluded by other facts. it being debatable was concluded by your urge to be right, and your urge to prove me wrong."
"canon"	"if you could provide an official source and not just your opinion saying it's not canon then i would admit your right, but it's just conjecture from you."
"canon"	"toriyama didn't create it, but he did create several designs for it, gave it his approval, encouraged people to watch it. would he do all that if he didn't consider it at least a little canon?"
"canon"	"he did that for the movies too, that doesn't make them canon, does it? does toriyama's small involvment overule the huge plot holes? no."
"canon"	"the difference is that they said the movies are not canon, they never said gt wasn't canon,"
"canon"	"they don't have to say it's non-canon! get that in your head! if they didn't announce the movies were non-canon, they would still be non-canon because of the same reasons gt is non-canon."
"canon"	"you're not getting it, just because you came to the conclusion that it's non-canon doesn't make it so, every show has plot holes, so toriyama not creating it doesn't automatically make it non-canon."
"canon"	"i came to the conclusion because of facts. you haven't provided a single fact, not even one, that supports gt being canon. (if you want to discuss this, use the talk page; you've broken 3rr (by \u224820))"
"canon"	"the editors on that page say it's a low level of canon(below db and dbz), but still officially canon."
"canon"	"tj, stop and think for a second. you have given zero facts that poitn to gt being non-canon, whereas i have given 5 facts that make it impossible for gt to be canon."
"canon"	"you have provided one fact, i have also provided several, plus no official source has ever said it's not canon."
"canon"	"i just explained them on the talk page(also, your fifth point doesn't count because they said that the movies are not canon but they never said gt isn't canon)."
"canon"	"tj, gt is non-canon. i have given you facts, i have proven it is non-canon, we have had a third opionion from nemu, and he agreed with me, so therefore you are being unreasonable and vandalizing."
"canon"	"you have not \"proven\" gt is non-canon, you stated why you think it's non-canon. i provided evidence to support why it could be canon."
"canon"	"see my reply. it is a fact (not my opinion) that it is non-canon, therefore it would be impossible to debate on the subject. you can't debate against a fact."
"canon"	"i am, we have no official answer, so i am trying to offer this compromise. i am not putting in \"bebi is canon\"(although i know he is)."
"canon"	"it is a fact, because canon is what was created by the original author, which gt was not. the definition of canon and the fact that toriyama didn't make it are my sources."
"canon"	"there is a source, tj. if something isn't in the manga, and it isn't made by toriyama, it's non-canon."
"canon"	"rv, vandalism (tj, we don't need a source. what is canon is what is created by the original author (toriyama), which gt is not.)"
"canon"	"rv. you have yet to provide a source saying that only what appears in the manga is canon."
"canon"	"the source is the definition of canon: \"the work of a particular author\". in this case, it's toriyama."
"canon"	"no, it doesn't. you missread it. read it again. nothing except the manga is canon."
"canon"	"toriyama has never disputed gt as not being canon, he seemed to do the complete opposite, do not remove the citation tag if you don't have a citation."
